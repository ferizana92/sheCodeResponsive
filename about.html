    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Toulouse, France</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I am a passionate and adaptable frontend web developer seeking remote
        roles that allow me to utilize my skills while fostering personal growth
        and continuous learning. With the ability to work across time zones, I
        am committed to creating engaging user experiences and staying at the
        forefront of industry trends.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a constantly learning, self-motivated, and organized front-end
        developer. While I excel in implementing web designs using JavaScript
        and React, I also have a keen eye for website performance. I am adept at
        developing applications and features, both externally and internally. I
        thrive under pressure and strict deadlines, ensuring efficient and
        high-quality deliverables. I am excited to bring my expertise and
        enthusiasm to contribute to the success of your organization.

        Learning on your own can only take you so far. Humans learn best from
        other humans. So, I started to learn coding about two years ago. Iâ€™ve
        got a built-in community of students who, just like me, are betting big
        on themselves. <br />
